Now printing testbench input sequence: 
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 68;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 30;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 1; data_in = 48;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 5;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 1; data_in = 60;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 55;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 1;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 99;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 1; data_in = 14;
@(posedge clk); dir_r = 0; data_in = 82;
End of testbench input sequence.
